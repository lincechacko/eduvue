   <h4>What is the problem we are solving (1/2)</h4>  
 <p>
    There are lot of free CRMs in market however they don’t address Education Industry
    specific problems listed below.<br>
    Problems for:<br>
    Educational Institutes:<br>
    1. Apart from big players, small players work on very thin margins to operate their institutes<br>
    2. Hence when it comes to technology, even after knowing its benefits, they lack investment
    capability and technology know-how to implement the same and reap benefits<br>
    3. Multiple tools for managing business. Increases cost of managing different tools and reduces
    efficiencies. Integration between different tools are also not easy.<br>
    4. Not able to analyse student’s performance and thereby a teacher’s efficiency<br>
    5. Increase reach out to new students
 </p>

<div class="col-lg-12 mt-5 text-center">
    <h4>What is the problem we are solving (2/2)</h4>
    <p>
        Teachers of these Institutes:<br>
1. Most of the teachers using blackboard to explain concepts. In such cases sharing, storing and
managing their classroom notes becomes tedious<br>
2. They spend lot of time evaluating physical answer sheet of students instead of focusing on
student learning<br>
3. During a class session, they are unable to quickly identify if students have understood the
concept or not<br>
4. Not able to track student performance with detailed insights<br>
Students of these Institutes:
1. They spend maximum time of classroom in copying what teacher has written on the board
rather than spending time in understanding the concept.<br>
2. In case they miss a class or 2, have to depend on other students for notes and concept
clearance
